# ClaudeFlow on a MacBook Pro M3 Pro

This guide is for running ClaudeFlow well on Apple Silicon without turning the laptop into a science project.

## The practical recommendation
- Keep `cheap` (gemini-2.5-flash-lite) as the default for daily ideation, drafting, and teammate workflows.
- Keep `deep` (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) for the hardest reasoning and final judgment.
- Use `local` (`auto`) as a worker model for drafts, reviews, summarization, and low-stakes code passes.
- If your team already has Gemini credits, it is a strong cheap hosted path before opening another paid API account.

## Why your M3 Pro is good enough
- Apple Silicon is a strong local-model machine because of unified memory and GPU acceleration.
- Ollama supports macOS on Apple M-series hardware and is improving Apple Silicon performance with MLX.
- That makes laptop-first local runs realistic for helper tasks during a hackathon or for startup sidecar automation.

## Best local model choices
- Automatic default: `auto`
  It picks `qwen2.5-coder:3b` for lightweight text work, `qwen2.5-coder:7b` for coding/review work, and `gemma3:4b` for vision-like prompts.
- Faster and lighter fallback: `qwen2.5-coder:3b`
- Stronger local coding pass when you have enough memory and patience: `qwen2.5-coder:14b`
- Local multimodal option for screenshots, mockups, or diagrams: `gemma3:4b`
- Stronger multimodal pass if your machine has more headroom: `gemma3:12b`

## Which one to use
- If you have 18 GB unified memory, start with 3B to 8B class models and keep other heavy apps closed.
- If you have 36 GB or more, 12B to 14B models become much more realistic for serious local work.
- Use local models for reviewer crews, categorization, summarization, test suggestions, and rough rewrites.
- Do not rely on a local model alone for the final architectural or product decision if a stronger hosted model is available.

## The best hackathon setup on this laptop
1. Use Claude or another strong hosted model for the hard thinking and last-mile debugging.
2. Use the `cheap` profile for most structured drafting and team-facing docs.
3. Use local Ollama models for repeated review loops and low-cost helpers.
4. Only touch cloud GPU deployment if the final demo itself needs hosted inference.

## Commands to start with
```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
ollama pull gemma3:4b
npx claudeflow doctor
npx claudeflow run pipelines/hackathon/crew-review.yaml --runtime ollama
```
- `claudeflow doctor` warns if the auto-router models are missing.

## When not to overcomplicate it
- If the team needs results fast, use hosted APIs first.
- If the laptop starts swapping memory or slowing the rest of your work, step back to a smaller model or go back to `cheap`.
- Local is there to save cost and add resilience, not to become the whole product strategy.
